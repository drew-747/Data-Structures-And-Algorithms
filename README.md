   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd data-structures-and-algorithms
   ```

3. Familiarize yourself with the project structure and explore the different folders and files.

4. Choose a data structure or algorithm you want to learn or practice, and navigate to the corresponding directory.

5. Read the README.md file in each directory to understand the problem, the implementation, and the test cases.

6. Implement the data structure or algorithm in both Python and C, following the guidelines provided.

7. Test your implementation using the provided test cases and any additional test cases you might want to add.

8. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to create a new issue or submit a pull request.
